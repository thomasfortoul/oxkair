# OPERATIVE REPORT

**Patient:** Jane Smith  
**MRN:** 987654321  
**Date of Service:** 2024-01-20  
**Provider:** Dr. Johnson  
**Department:** Orthopedic Surgery  

## PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
Right knee osteoarthritis

## POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS  
Right knee osteoarthritis

## PROCEDURE PERFORMED
Right total knee arthroplasty

## DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE

The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in supine position. Spinal anesthesia was administered successfully. A tourniquet was applied to the right thigh. The right lower extremity was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.

A midline skin incision was made over the right knee extending from approximately 2 cm proximal to the patella to 2 cm distal to the tibial tuberosity. The incision was carried down through subcutaneous tissue. A medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed.

The patella was everted and the knee was flexed. Significant osteoarthritic changes were noted throughout the joint with bone-on-bone contact areas and osteophyte formation.

**Femoral Preparation:**
- The distal femur was cut using the intramedullary guide system
- 6mm of bone was removed from the distal femur
- The anterior and posterior femoral cuts were made
- The femoral component trial was placed and found to have excellent fit

**Tibial Preparation:**  
- The tibial cut was made removing approximately 8mm of bone
- The tibial component trial was placed with excellent coverage
- No overhang was noted

**Patellar Preparation:**
- The patella was resurfaced
- Appropriate thickness was maintained
- The patellar component trial showed good tracking

**Final Implantation:**
- All components were cemented in place using antibiotic-loaded bone cement
- A size 3 femoral component was implanted
- A size 3 tibial component with polyethylene insert was implanted  
- A 32mm patellar component was implanted
- Excellent range of motion was achieved from full extension to 120 degrees of flexion

The joint was thoroughly irrigated. Hemostasis was achieved. A drain was placed in the joint. The arthrotomy was closed with #1 Vicryl suture. The subcutaneous tissue was closed with 2-0 Vicryl suture. The skin was closed with staples.

A sterile dressing was applied. The tourniquet was deflated with good capillary refill noted in all digits.

## FINDINGS
- Severe tricompartmental osteoarthritis
- Significant osteophyte formation
- Cartilage loss with bone-on-bone contact
- No evidence of infection

## COMPLICATIONS
None

## ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS
200 mL

## CONDITION
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.

## IMPLANTS USED
- Zimmer Persona femoral component, size 3
- Zimmer Persona tibial component, size 3  
- Zimmer Persona patellar component, 32mm
- Zimmer Persona polyethylene insert, 10mm

## POSTOPERATIVE PLAN
- Physical therapy to begin postoperative day 1
- Weight bearing as tolerated
- DVT prophylaxis with Lovenox
- Pain management with multimodal approach
- Follow-up in 2 weeks for wound check and staple removal
