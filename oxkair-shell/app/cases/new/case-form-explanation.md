Of course. I'd be happy to explain how the new pages work together.

### High-Level Overview

The core of the new implementation is the reusable `CaseForm` component. This single component is now responsible for both creating new cases and editing existing ones. This consolidation simplifies the codebase, reduces redundancy, and ensures a consistent user experience across the application.

### The `CaseForm` Component

The `CaseForm` component, located in `oxkair2/oxkair-shell/app/cases/new/case-form.tsx`, is the heart of the case management system. It's a versatile component that dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the `caseId` prop it receives.

Here's how it works:

1.  **Conditional Logic**: The component checks if a `caseId` is provided.
    *   If a `caseId` exists, it fetches the corresponding case data from the database and populates the form fields, allowing the user to edit the existing case. The title of the page will also reflect that the user is editing a case (e.g., "Edit Case: 12345").
    *   If no `caseId` is provided, the component presents a blank form, ready for creating a new case. The title will be "Create New Case".

2.  **State Management**: The component manages the state of all form fields, including patient details, clinical notes, and billable notes.

3.  **User Actions**: The `CaseForm` handles all user actions, such as:
    *   **CSV Upload**: Users can upload a CSV file to populate the form fields.
    *   **Pend Case**: This saves the current state of the case as "INCOMPLETE" and navigates the user back to the comprehensive dashboard.
    *   **Process Case**: This initiates the AI workflow to process the clinical notes and then routes the user to the appropriate review page based on their role.

### How the Pages Work Together

1.  **`oxkair2/oxkair-shell/app/cases/new/page.tsx`**: This is now the single entry point for all case creation and editing. It uses the `CaseForm` component and determines whether to create a new case or edit an existing one based on the presence of a `caseId` in the URL's query parameters.

2.  **`oxkair2/oxkair-shell/app/coder/comprehensive/page.tsx`**: The comprehensive dashboard is the central hub for viewing all cases. When a user clicks on a case with the status of "INCOMPLETE", it now navigates to `/cases/new?caseId=<case_id>`, loading the `CaseForm` with the appropriate case data for editing. All other statuses will navigate to the appropriate review page.

By using this new, consolidated approach, we've created a more streamlined and maintainable system for managing cases. Let me know if you have any other questions.
