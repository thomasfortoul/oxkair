Operative Note 2 â€“ Simple Case with Clear Diagnoses and Procedures
Patient: Mary S., 52-year-old female
Preoperative Diagnosis: Symptomatic cholelithiasis with acute cholecystitis
Postoperative Diagnosis: Chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis
Procedure: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy
Anesthesia: General anesthesia

Operative Details:
The patient was positioned supine on the operating table after standard preoperative preparation and induction of general anesthesia. A four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. On entry, the gallbladder was noted to be distended, with a thickened wall and multiple cholesterol stones. The cystic duct and cystic artery were identified using the critical view of safety. The cystic duct was clipped and divided, and the cystic artery was ligated and transected. Dissection continued along the gallbladder bed, which was carefully separated from the liver. There was no evidence of bile leak or active hemorrhage. The gallbladder was placed in an extraction bag and removed through the umbilical port. Hemostasis was achieved, and the ports were closed with absorbable sutures. The patient emerged from anesthesia without complications and was scheduled for standard postoperative follow-up.
