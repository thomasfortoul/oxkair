ANESTHESIOLOGIST: Anesthesiologist: Karl Willmann, MD
Clinical Anesthetist: Damein M Burgess, CRNA
ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 25 mL 
INDICATIONS: Patient is a 25 year old male who underwent lap J tube last week for feeding access in setting of gastrocutaneous fistula. Dilation of the colon precluded access to the stomach and we returned today for gastrocutaneous fistula management. Laparoscopic takedown and resiting was advised and, after discussing the risks and benefits of surgery, the patient agreed to proceed with surgical intervention. Of note, the patient requires high volumes of fluid infused and his mother preferred he keep a G tube for this purpose rather than use the PICC that he had been using. 
 
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: 
The colon was smaller than prior allowing visualization of the stomach and takedown of the fistula site. A new 16 french gastrostomy tube was placed distal to the prior tube, in the midline of the upper abdomen. The existing jejunostomy tube was left in place. 
 
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position on the operating room table. General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A timeout was called. The abdomen was entered using a Veress needle technique through a supraumbilical horizontal skin incision. Pneumoperitoneum was established and the Veress needle was exchanged for a 5 mm trocar. The laparoscope was inserted and 3 additional trocars were placed under direct visualization following the instillation of 0.25 percent Marcaine with epinephrine.   
 
The transverse colon was swept down from the upper midline to expose the gastrostomy tube site. The site was taken down with harmonic scalpel. The site was closed with a running 3-0 absorbable barbed suture. Endoscopic leak test was negative for leak. A combination of blunt and ultrasonic dissection was used to mobilize the stomach off of the anterior abdominal wall and left lobe of the liver to allow placement of a new gastrostomy tube. Endoscopic Inflation of the stomach with the endoscope was used to distend the stomach and find a location (distal to the prior tube site) to pexy stomach to anterior abdominal wall in the midline. This gastropexy was accomplished with a 2-0 absorbable barbed suture. Using a percutaneous method, the stomach was accessed with a needle and air insufflation test used to confirm intraluminal gastric placement. A wire was placed through the needle and over a wire a 20french dilator was inserted. The 16 french gastrostomy tube was inserted through the dilator and peel away sheath removed. The balloon was inflated with 5mL of water. 
 
Repeat endoscopy was performed. The balloon was visualized within the gastric lumen along the anterior wall of the stomach proximal to the pylorus. The gastroscope was then removed. The abdomen was inspected for hemostasis and foreign body, which was adequate. All sponge and needle counts were correct. The trocars were subsequently removed under direct vision. The fascia at the 10mm trocar was re-approximated using 0 absorbable suture. The skin was closed with subcuticular absorbable suture and skin adhesive.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was then extubated and transported to recovery in stable condition.
