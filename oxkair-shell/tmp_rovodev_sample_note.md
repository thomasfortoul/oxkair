Edwin Raymond Pynenberg is a 69 year old male with a symptomatic recurrent massive ventral incisional hernia and recurrent metastatic colon cancer of the liver. He was scheduled for resection of the liver mets and I was asked to assist with entry and closure given the complex abdominal wall.  All risks and benefits were discussed with the patient and operative consent was obtained.
 
The patient was taken to the OR and transferred to the OR table in supine position. A preop time-out was performed and all were in agreement. Patient received preoperative antibiotics and heparin. SCDs were placed. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced. A Foley catheter was placed. We began with an upper abdominal midline laparotomy and entered the abdomen safely. We encountered the hernia sac. We incised this. We encountered dense omental adhesions. We performed an extensive adhesiolysis. Of note modifier 22 should be added for complexity of the case due to the multiple recurrent hernias, and patient body habitus, all of which increased operative difficulty. 
 
Once we had taken down the midline we performed a complete intraabdominal adhesiolysis. Once we performed that, we performed excisional debridement of nonviable muscle, fascia, subcutaneous tissue and hernia sac.  There was one full-thickness enterotomy which was repaired with 3-0 vicryl sutures transversely.  This was inherent with the complexity of the case. I then turned the case over to Dr. Weber for her portion of the case.  
 
After Dr. Weber's portion I then assumed control of the case.  All counts were reported correct. We then debrided the old surgical foreign body and nonviable muscle and fascia until we got back to healthy tissue. We were then left with the abdominal wall and healthy native fascia.  We then took our healthy anterior fascial edges bilaterally and closed with interrupted figure-of-eight #1 PDS sutures. This brought the fascia together nicely without significant tension except for a small 10x2cm area in the M3 zone where I felt the tension would be too great for a durable closure.  We chose to suture in a bridge of Phasix ST mesh with the coated side against the viscera.  We used #1 Prolene to suture this in circumferentially. We then irrigated with 2L irrisept  and then washed with saline.  We placed a drain in the subq space and then closed the skin with staples with disposable NPWT over the top.  
 
I was present and scrubbed for the duration of the case. All counts were reported as correct to me at the completion of the case.
